# asterio
A 2D game made with Godot Engine. This game is about a lonely space engineer that must automate collection of recources
whilst floating through space. Many challenges occur as the engineer floats through space, frequently meeting other
astranauts, some good some bad, that might want something from him. The engineer must be prepared to deal with the bad
and trade with the good. If the engineer doesn't meet quotas of resources every now and then, the evil CroakTech 
will come and decide their fate.
